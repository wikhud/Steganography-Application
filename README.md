# Steganography Application
This steganography app was created as a part of my bachelor thesis.
The implementation bases on mechanism called "least significant bit". The code represents entire "autoencoder".

The encoder is used to embed the digital data such as text of image in another image. The decoder is used to extract hidden data from given image.
